<div class="title">Is this page secure?</div>
This page uses only javascript and html to generate passwords. There is no form submission -- purposefully -- so there is no way for the server to see or store your passwords (including the master). It would be a security risk to send passwords over an HTTP (not HTTPS) connection, and also to store them whatsoever (even encrypted) on a server; not to mention a violation of your privacy.<br/>
<br/>
All settings except the master password are stored on your local PC as a cookie, so the settings will be the same next time you visit this page. If you'd like to store the master password also, check the <i>Save master password</i> checkbox. The master password will then be stored <b>encrypted</b> as an cookie on your local machine. Saving the master password, even though it's encrypted with AES encryption, is not completely secure; you are sacrificing some security for convenience. Theoretically, a hacker could determine your master password if he:
<ul>
<li>Could access the encrypted master password and key, stored as cookies, on your PC</li>
<li>Knew to use AES-256 to decrypt the master password</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Even then, a hacker wouldn't be able to use the master password to login anywhere if you only use generated passwords for your passwords. Moreover, a succesful login to any system also requires a username.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, if this security risk concerns you, you shouldn't check the "Save master password" checkbox. If you've checked it by mistake, simply clear your cookies or, alternatively, uncheck the <i>Save master password</i> box and navigate away from this page. This forces an empty value to be stored for the master password.<br/>
