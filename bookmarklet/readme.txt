PasswordMaker Click! Edition
Version 0.6

This downloaded copy of PasswordMaker Click! Edition is meant for you to run off your own server.
Just upload to a directory and you should be set to use Click! Edition.

If you have server side scripting but not with PHP, it should be easy enough to make your own script.
If you want, you may submit it to us to add for future releases. All this script does is replace replace some text in two files (and display the form to create the bookmarklet).
To allow for easy sharing of the form itself, the form may be split from the PHP as another file.

The jsmin and packjs PHP files and the *-src.js files are only if you are helping with development or want to make your own modifications.
