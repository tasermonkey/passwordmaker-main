Name Eric came up with: Click! Edition

There's a PHP script that controls rewriting some of the javascript.
For the bookmarklet, it edits the url the bookmarklet uses to get the main script.
For the main script, it edits a prefix used so that injection is hard to do, and the root url to feeding the parameters back in.
Other scripting langauges can be used, PHP is the one MiquelFire (the creator of the bookmarklet) knew.

For IE6 support, we have 477 bytes total to work with.
The script that creates the bookmarklet will reject some features for IE6 users as a result.

url1.js did hit the safe limit for most other browsers before any existing code was brought in.

Feature Notes:
==============
Legend: + is a postive feature or happy side effect, - is a negative feature or bad side effect of the bookmarklet

+Any browser with a bookmark bar will have quick access to PasswordMaker! Click, enter master password, profit! (No ??? step)

+If user has a bookmark sync, PasswordMaker settings will be synced as well.

+If the user reason for making accounts relate to default being used for 90%, and 9% needing a different characterset, they may have less 'accounts'.
Sort of like the the profile system on the on-line edition.

-IE6 has no custom character set, and can't use the username, modifier, prefix, and suffix fields.
Master password hash may not be an option either.

-Can't easily change settings without recreating the bookmark (and no plans to allow on the fly editing).

PHP Notes:
==========
When called without parameters, display a form to allow the user to build a bookmarklet.
The only editing of the script done by PHP will be to set the url to get the main code.

If the h parameter is called, the php script will send the main logic to the user (basically, the main part of PasswordMaker that wouldn't fit in a bookmarklet)

There will be a v parameter to pick a version to use. Meant to control which 'protocol' is used in the bookmarklet.
For now, I only see this set at 1.

Script Notes:
=============
A special hash id will be used instead of pwmbklhash123456 for the main function (and the prefix for the other global variables).
As this id may start with a number (a no no in JavaScript variables), a h is used as the first character.

A 'protocol' will be used to allow for compact parameter settings.

There's an 8-10 byte string for the parts of the parameters that can be set by one character (3 for the length).
Full details in the url1-src.js file.

Another parameter is a string if using IE6 to hold the text being used in place of the calculated url.
This is an object in other browsers containing the other bits of info needed to generate a password.
