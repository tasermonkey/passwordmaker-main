This program uses QSharedMemory from QT 4.4 (This bumps up the requirements from 4.3 however as a
result) to prevent multiple copies from running, for installers to shut down it down, and to trigger
other events from other applications

The key used is "PWMDE".

The size used is 30 bytes

The first 30 bytes has the following layout:
0x00 (1 byte) - If zero, then your program was the first to use this memory.
	If 1, then this program last wrote to it, most likely took action on a command
	If 2, this another program wrote to this memory, and the first instance should take action
	Any other value is an error
0x01 (1 byte) - Version of shared memory map. Currently 1
0x02 (8 bytes) - The pid of the program (signed).
0x0A (1 byte) - Command to send to this program:
	0x00 - Nothing. Clears info from other program
	0x01 - Grab focus (normally from another instance trying to run)
	0x02 - Quit (normally from the installer, triggers prompt)
	0x03 - Open TCP port (or change it if previous value doesn't work)
0x0C (2 bytes) - TCP port used for communication of other actions that pass data back and forth.
0x0D - 0x1D - Reserved for future use, leave at zero
